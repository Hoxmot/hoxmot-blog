# hoxmot-blog

Just me dabbling with my personal blog that I hope I'll finish one day, hopefully before I retire.

Also, I'm not a frontend developer, so it's my practice ground for learning how to build and design frontend applications.

This might be fun, probably I'll never finish. It is what it is.
