Hello, team! I'm Hoxmot.

I'm a Software Development Engineer with a passion for building things. I joined the tech industry about 10 years ago and have worked across different positions, levels, and tech stacks. I appreciate innovative technology, but I’m not a fan of hype for hype's sake.

When I'm not coding, you can usually find me deep into a video game or playing around with hardware.

I built this blog to have a place to dump my thoughts, reviews, notes, and ideas in those three categories: Software Development, Video Games, and Tech & Gear. Let's call it a digital garden, where I can tend to my ideas.

Feel free to join me on this adventure. Currently, the best way to stay up to date is to follow the RSS feeds:

- [Global Feed (All categories)](/rss.xml)
- [Software Development Feed](/category/software/rss.xml)
- [Video Games Feed](/category/games/rss.xml)
- [Tech & Gear Feed](/category/games/rss.xml)

## Connect

I'm always open to discussing new projects, game recommendations, or the latest tech news. Feel free to reach out to me on the social platforms linked below in the footer.
