---

Hello! I'm Hoxmot. I'm a software developer with a passion for building clean, efficient web applications and exploring the latest in technology.

When I'm not coding, you can usually find me deep into a video game, tweaking my mechanical keyboard, or experimenting with new Linux distros. This blog is my digital garden where I share my thoughts, reviews, and tutorials on the three pillars of my digital life: Software, Video Games, and Tech.

## The Stack

This website itself is a testament to the tools I love. It's built with Astro for performance, styled with **Tailwind CSS** for speed, and type-checked with **TypeScript** for sanity. It uses a custom "Fire & Ice" theme designed to be easy on the eyes, whether you're reading in the bright morning or late at night.

## Connect

I'm always open to discussing new projects, game recommendations, or the latest tech news. Feel free to reach out to me on the social platforms linked below in the footer.
