Astro has revolutionized the way we build static sites. By defaulting to zero JavaScript, it ensures that your content is delivered as fast as possible.

This is the lead paragraph, which should be rendered in Inter font.

## Why Astro?

It allows you to bring your own framework (React, Vue, Svelte) but only hydrate the components when necessary. This architecture is known as "Islands Architecture".

```js
// Example of an Astro component
const name = 'Hoxmot';
console.log(`Hello ${name}`);
```

The build performance is incredible, and the developer experience is top-notch.
